# Articles

This is the start of a collection of various write-ups and short articles. 

### Table of content

* [**Introduction to Cartopy, Part 1**](Articles/Introduction_to_Cartopy_Part1.ipynb)  
How to start with the map-making python library Cartopy. This article is an adaption/rework of an already existing course

* [**Introduction to Cartopy, Part 2**](Articles/Introduction_to_Cartopy_Part2.ipynb)  
This part covers more advanced map-making and is still under construction

* [**Regional maps with Cartopy**](Articles/CartopyRegionalMaps.ipynb)  
Collections of examples of ready-made Cartopy map set ups of various regions. 

* [**IBSCO data in python**](Articles/IBSCO_data_in_Python.ipynb)  
Load high-resolution IBSCO bathymetry data of the Southern Ocean and display it with Python.  
To highlight the high resolution, the map is shaded to also show small topographic changes.

* [**Southern Ocean Climate Modes**](Articles/Plotting_Southern_Ocean_Climate_Modes.ipynb)  
Read-in of data from the SAM and ONI climate mode index, Calculation of the SEI index and plot all 3.
  - Basically time series manipulation with the pandas library

* [**Potential Density Shenanigans**](Articles/Potential_Density_Shenanigans.ipynb)  
The Pitfalls of calculating potential density for a CTD profile and the maybe surprisingly strong impact of the reference pressure

* [**How to read in Polarstern CTD data from Pangaea**](Articles/Read_in_Polarstern_CTD_data_from_Pangaea.ipynb)  
This article is a shortened version of **Potential Density Shenanigans**, concentrating only on the data read-in.

* [**Unnecessary artsy ridge maps**](Articles/Unnecessary_artsy_ridge_maps.ipynb)  
  Scientifically useless, but beautiful visualizations of topography
